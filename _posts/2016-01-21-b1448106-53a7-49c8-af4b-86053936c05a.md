I'm blown away by **David Bowie.** He's probably the only person who could be one of the coolest cats on the planet while dealing with Stage 4 cancer. I highly recommend the album and the song Blackstar. [Watch the video below starting at 4:40 and ending around 7:00\.][0] To me, it's as good as anything Bowie's ever done.

Huge respect to a guy that was always an influence to my generation from early-teens until today. I respect anybody who constantly re-invents themselves. It's super difficult; if it wasn't, everyone would do it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/61fb2447-0c85-4f87-8109-d03353456b9d.jpg)
