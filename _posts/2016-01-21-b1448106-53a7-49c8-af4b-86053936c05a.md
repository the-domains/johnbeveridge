I'm blown away by David Bowie. He's probably the only person who could be one of the coolest cats on the planet while dealing with Stage 4 cancer. I highly recommend the album and the song Blackstar. Watch the video below starting at 4:40 and ending around 7:00\. To me, it's as good as anything Bowie's ever done.

Huge respect to a guy that was always an influence to my generation from early-teens until today. I respect anybody who constantly re-invents themselves. It's super difficult; if it wasn't, everyone would do it.
